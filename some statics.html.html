        <p><big>fact3:-The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas where the climate is hot and humid
            From the evidence available so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Whatever the climate, take precautions if you live in or intend to travel to an area where COVID-19 infection has been reported. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from contracting COVID-19 is to wash your hands regularly. By doing this, you can get rid of viruses that may be stuck on your hands and thus avoid possible infection if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose.</big></p>
         <p><big>We can imagine the virus as an enemy that attacks with cell shells that cause us to encourage the existing version of the virus, the apricot, and then the infection. This vaccine has been able to obtain antibodies resulting from exposure to the virus. This high-volume scaling simulation requires high-speed computers...supercomputers.</big></p>
