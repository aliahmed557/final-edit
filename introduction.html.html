        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

            The microscopic images of the Corona virus have been colorized to facilitate viewing.
            
            The institute said on its website that the images of the emerging coronavirus are not very different from MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which appeared in 2012) or the original SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus, which appeared in 2002).
            The institute considered this not surprising, "The crowns on the surface of these viruses give the virus family its name - Corona, because it resembles the appearance of the crown."</p></center>
